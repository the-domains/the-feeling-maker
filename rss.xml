            <title><![CDATA[ A one time virtuoso physician sits at his dim lit office at the end of the emergency hallway where he sees patients on the rare occasions his front line colleagues fail to make the diagnosis. The ladies sit and wait for an opening sentence from Dr. Bardino while he holds his forehead with one hand and fumbles a pen over a sheet of paper with the other leaving the patient to finally explode in a burst of anger asking what the hell did he think she was there for. A young woman complaining of severe abdominal pain showing no lesion in medical imaging and no clues in her blood work up could be under emotional distress although a series of personal life questions result negative – except when he asks her about her father, what is accompanied by an outrageous remark from mother sitting next to her. Looking deeply for the patient´s disease makes Bardino fall into a dark space where he finds himself attached to a mass of entangled tissue and spines that is about to engulf him whereas he seems unable to set off the powerful immune darts that could defeat it. Tom Bardino meets the emergency medical supervisor he tells him that the patient has retroperitoneal panniculitis and although the supervisor looks suspicious at his diagnosis Bardino emphasizes that if treated accordingly she should be fit within the next 48 hours.]]></title>
