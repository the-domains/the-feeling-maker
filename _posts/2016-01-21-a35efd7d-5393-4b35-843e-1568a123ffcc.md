It is of the utmost importance to understand the role of the _uncinate fasciculus_ in human life. This is two-way mielinated nerve cell bundle that connects the older regions of the temporal lobe in the brain to the more recently evolved thinking and deciding forebrain areas. Yes, a two-way road but what we see in practice is that the hyper-reactive link under the influence of the amygdala is much more powerful that the rational or even feeling-driven influence of the frontal areas on our behavior.
