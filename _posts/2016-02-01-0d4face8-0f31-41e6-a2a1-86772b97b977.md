It is two-way myelinated nerve cell bundle that connects older regions of the temporal lobe to the more recently evolved thinking and deciding forebrain areas.****Yes, it is a two-way road but what we see in practice is that the hyper-reactive link under the influence of the amygdala is much more powerful that the rational or even feeling-driven influence of the frontal areas on our behavior**.**
